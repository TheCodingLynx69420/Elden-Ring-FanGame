<h3>Controls: use arrow keys (up, left, right) Warning: do not mash/spam the "up key" as it can glitch out your character and make it unable to jump for a little amount of time, So atleast wait for 1 second before pressing the up key again </h3>

<h3>This was really fun to make, it was just supposed to be a normal "dino chrome game" but i used my creativity to change the whole game layout and models and made it more interesting! XD</h3>
